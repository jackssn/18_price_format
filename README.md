# Price Formatter

The script takes input price and changes it to pretty view like `xx xxx.xx` or `x xxx`. Code able to take your number
from console and show pretty view there. Or you can import the function `format_price` from `format_price.py` and use
it in your code.

# How it works

1. If you want to use script into console type in terminal:

    `python format_price.py YOUR_PRICE` and get output like:

    `xx xxx xxx.xx` from your number
2. If you want to use script in your code you need:

    `from format_price import format_price`

    The function takes your price with commas, dots and spaces. If there is something else it returns `None`
